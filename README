This is an R package that allows you to easily conduct analysis on your email.

In order to use this R package, you also need to run a python script to extract your email and store data as a .csv file.
The data can then be retreived by the R package to run analysis. 

The primary use of this package is for gmail analysis between you and one other person, although code can be easily
manipulated to include analysis with others as well (this would be done in the python code).

Some highlight functions included in the R package are:
 -- analysis and graphing of emails sent by time of day
 -- analysis and graphing of email reply times by time of day
 -- analysis and visual word cloud of most common words in subject lines
